# LEDFrequencyAnalyzer

I made this 64x64 LED Matrix Frequency Analyzer using an audio jack, MSGEQ7 chip, a Teensy 3.6 and SmartLED Shield.
### Components

1. Teensy 3.6
2. 64x64 LED matrix display 
3. 100 nF capacitor - 2 
4. 100k Ohm Resistor - 2 (or 1 200k Ohm Resistor)
5. 10 nF capacitor 
6. 22k Resistor - 2
7. SmartLED Matrix Shield
8. 3.5 mm Audio Jack

### Schematic

This is the schematic I used. It's the original MSGEQ7 recommended datasheet plus an audio jack.
If the schematic is not clear, the OUT pin went to 19, STROBE 11, and RESET 12.
